# SnapQR

A Basic QR Code Generator made open source from chotuurl for all my fellow learners in CodingPandas....

--- Chotuurl as a whole was a big project still under development. The Qr Code Generator was just a tiny feature among all. Chotuurl Includes a Link-in-Generator, Advanced LInk Analytics for link tracking and so much more.

Now the code in here might be hard to understand as it was written inside the chotuurl project and the classes names were given accordingly. I just have copy-pasted the code... I will rewrite it again to make it easy to understand. But as 
for now you can run it and see how good it is and give your opinions.
